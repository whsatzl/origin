# 05.6 Practice

Let's use our knowledge of else-if statements to help Code Nation students find access to free broadband internet depending on where they live (California, Illinois, or New York)!

The variables have already been declared for you on lines 1-5. Begin your code inside the click handler.

## Instructions

## Code Along!
1. Following along with your instructor, write that `if` statement that would display the `california` `div` if a user says they're from California.

2. Next, write the `else if` statement that would display the `illinois` `div` if a user says they're from Illinois. **Note:** Model this after the California if statement above. 

## Code it Solo!

3. Your turn! Underneath your IL else if statement, write another `else if` statement that displays the `newyork` `div` if the user say they're from New York.

4. Write an `else statement` that displays a different message in the `other` `div` if the user types in a different state.

5. Finished early? Add another state of your choosing! * Hint: You will need to add a unique div for that state in the html, as well as declare a new variable in the Javascript editor.
